# flutter_example
The example is in under development.
This demonstrates the basic page build in flutter.
I am following the tutorial: [ Building your first Flutter app](https://youtu.be/Z6KZ3cTGBWw), [this codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0), and [this github sample.](https://github.com/flutter/codelabs/tree/main/namer/step_08)

We also can play with [dartpad.dev.](https://dartpad.dev/?id=e7076b40fb17a0fa899f9f7a154a02e8) There are also various precompiled examples.

**Output till now:**
